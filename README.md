Doctor Appointment Booking System

   
     The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system that provides patients or any user an easy way of booking a doctor’s appointment online. This is a web based application that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments according to user’s choice or demands. The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability. Hence this project offers an effective solution where users can view various booking slots available and select the preferred date and time. The already booked space will be marked yellow and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system also allows users to cancel their booking anytime. 

Modules:
•	Admin Login: The system is under supervision of admin who manages the bookings made. 
•	User login/registration: Users have to first register themselves to login into the system. 
•	Three clinic areas: The system will provide users with three clinic areas of different locations.
•	Appointment availability check: User can click on spaces to view the availability. 
•	Appointment booking online for date and time: Users can book appointment for their required date and time.
•	Automatic cost calculation: The system calculates the total cost incurred for parking based on the time that user has asked for booking.
•	Booking cancellation: User may even cancel their bookings by login into the system anytime. 
•	Email on appointment booking: When user is successful in appointment  confirmation and 'thank you' email regarding the alot booked.
•	Feedback: The system has a feedback form, where user can provide feedback into the system.
